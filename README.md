# code-samples
Various small code examples/projects of mine. I tried to add as much description as possible, especially for coding problems that I myself got stuck on--even after looking at online solutions when I couldn't figure it out on my own initially, sometimes it took a while to wrap my head around how a data structure or algorithm really worked. Hopefully my in-depth explanations can help make sense of something confusing!
